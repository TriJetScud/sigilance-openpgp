== SIGILANCE Fork of Java Card OpenPGP Applet

This project implements the OpenPGP card functionality used on the
SIGILANCE OpenPGP smart card that is sold by Panchromatic, LLC.

This project is based on the
https://github.com/Yubico/ykneo-openpgp[ykneo-openpgp applet],
which is in turn based on the
http://sourceforge.net/p/javacardopenpgp/[Java Card OpenPGP Card]
project made by Joeri de Ruiter. Commits to this project come primarily
from Joey Castillo, who maintains
https://github.com/josecastillo/ykneo-openpgp[his own development repository here].
It is mirrored here to provide a consistent permalink to the code that
is shipped on SIGILANCE OpenPGP smart cards.

While the modifications to the upstream project were once minor, the
applet's codebase has matured significantly since that fork was made.
In collaboration with the community, the Yubico fork has fixed a
critical security vulnerability, incorporated bug fixes, and cut the
applet's transient memory usage in half.

The SIGILANCE fork of the Yubico project consists of feature
enhancements — most significantly, support for private use data
objects — as well as one minor change to set the ATR of the smart card,
a formality that is not necessary on the Yubikey NEO hardware.

=== License

The upstream project was released under the GPLv2+ and our fork uses
the same license.  All of our changes are released under the same
license.  See the file LICENSE for more information.


=== Building

See doc/Building.txt for information on how to build the source code
and doc/InstallCAPFile.txt on how to install it.


=== Usage

Tutorials for setting up the NFC-enabled SIGILANCE OpenPGP smart card
using OpenKeychain on Android are available at
https://www.sigilance.com/documentation/[the SIGILANCE documentation page],
including examples for
https://www.sigilance.com/documentation/android-key-generation/[creating a new identity],
https://www.sigilance.com/documentation/android-key-export/[copying an existing identity onto a smart card],
and
https://www.sigilance.com/documentation/android-adding-subkeys/[adding smart card-compatible keys to an existing identity].

The OpenPGP Card applet can also be used with http://www.gnupg.org[GnuPG],
and you may refer to its documentation for a full reference

Yubico also maintains tutorials on other applet-related topics at
https://developers.yubico.com/PGP[developers.yubico.com/PGP], for example card
editing and key import.
